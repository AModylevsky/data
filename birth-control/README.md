- 	**What is this?**: Data representing some of the questions asked on the Female Questionnaire of the CDC's National Survey of Family Growth.
-   **Source(s) & Methodology**: All data was acquired from the CDC’s [National Survey of Family Growth](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/index.htm). I combined the results of the [2006-2010](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg_2006_2010_puf.htm), [2011-2013](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg_2011_2013_puf.htm), and [2013-2015](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg_2013_2015_puf.htm) versions of the Female Questionnaire. Each of these surveys was administered “[continuously](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/about_nsfg.htm)”, or weekly over the course of several years instead of all at once. All survey-takers were “[household residents](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nsfg/NSFG_2013-2015_Summary_Design_Data_Collection.pdf#page3)” (i.e., not living in an institution such as prison, homes for juvenile delinquents, homes for the intellectually disabled, long-term psychiatric hospitals, and those living on military bases) living in the 50 United States or District of Columbia of reproductive age (15-44 years). The study design was intended to provide nationally representative sample that [oversamples](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nsfg/NSFG_2013-2015_Summary_Design_Data_Collection.pdf#page3) for non-Hispanic black people, Hispanic people, and teens aged 15-19. Any respondent that had never used any form of contraception was excluded from this analysis. More information about the CDC’s surveying methods is available [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/about_nsfg.htm).
  - Not all questions included in this dataset were included in the final article, but since nearly all questions were analyzed at some point in the preliminary analysis, they are included here.
  - Since nearly all responses are coded as numbers, the links to the codebook for each question are included in the table below.
